Once onion is translucent, reduce heat to medium low and allow onions to brown, stirring every few minutes. Allowing the onions to wilt, turn completely brown and caramelize will take about 30 to 40 minutes.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.Prepare a lightly oiled baking sheet  (a 9 x 13 works great, but no worries if yours is bigger). Turn the dough out onto the sheet and press it into the sheet with your palms until the dough meets the edges or until dough is about  thick. Poke holes into the surface of the dough with your finger then drizzle 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil over it. Use your hands to evenly coat the dough with the oil. Allow the dough to sit another 10 to 20 minutes until it appears puffy and swollen again.",

I just knead it right in the bowl.  Stop kneading as soon as the dough comes together and is soft and not too stickydo not over knead!  Try to knead it no more than 10 times if that helps.Form a ball, place it in the center of the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm spot for 20 minutes.After 20 minutes the dough wont really look any different, dont worry about it.  Divide the dough into 8 sections and roll into balls.Re-cover the balls with the plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.On a floured surface roll the balls out, either in a round or oval shape.  Meanwhile heat an iron skillet (or just plain skillet if thats all you have) on medium-high heat.Whack the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cover with a lid.  In less than the time you can roll out another ball the first side will be done, check the bread, when its nice and bubbly on the raw side flip it over and cook for a few more seconds.Thats it, get it out of the pan and put it on a plate or in your mouth or whatever! yum!",

Lightly beat one of the eggs, add that to the yeast mixture.In the work bowl of a stand mixer, combine the bread flour, all-purpose flour and salt. Work the softened butter into the flour by rubbing it between your fingertips, until it is completely dispersed.Using the dough hook attachment on your mixer, and running the mixer on low speed, add in the water/yeast mixture. After a minute or two, when everything more or less comes together (you may need to stop the mixer and scrape down the flour around the sides to get everything to mix together), increase the mixer speed to medium and knead for about 8-10 minutes. If your dough is still extremely wet (more batter-like than dough-like) you can add a little bit of extra flour at the end, a tablespoon at a time, until it comes together enough to handle.Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead an additional minute or two and shape into a ball.",

Shape each piece of dough into a ball and place evenly spaced onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the buns rise until doubled in size, another 1-2 hours.When buns are nearly finished rising, place a shallow baking pan, filled with about an inch of hot water, on the lowest rack of the oven (the buns will bake on the center rack). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg with 2 t. water.",
