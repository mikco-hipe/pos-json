You will need 3 of them for the actual sheets and 1 for decorative crumbs, which you can easily make with your fingers.Now for the cream: Beat the eggs with the sugar and flour. Boil the milk. While the milk is warming, pour about 1/2 cup into the egg mix and stir well to gradually increase its temperature. This way the eggs wont curdle when you add them to boiling milk. Repeat this step 2-3 more times as the milk approaches boiling temperature.Once the milk boils, pour the warm egg mix into the boiling milk, constantly stirring, to prevent lumps from forming. Keep on the stove for several 3 more minutes, continue stirring. Its best to use hand held mixer in this stage.",

Set on cookie rack and let cool for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, slice fruit to prepare for topping.Once tart crust is cooled, scoop in and smooth out the yogurt layer. Finally, top with your fruit, working from the center out.Note: the tart will not serve in a sliced form. It will be messy as the yogurt is not set.

So, in a heavy bottomed saucepan add the full milk, salt, tapioca, the seeds from the vanilla pod, and the empty vanilla pod. Bring this mix to a gentle simmer and stir occasionally. Do this until the tapioca is translucent and tender, this takes about 20 minutes. When cooked, stir in the coconut milk.While the tapioca mix is cooking you can whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl - quite big as it has to hold half of your tapioca mix too.",

Then pour this back into the pan and place on a medium heat.On a medium heat keep whisking until the mix thickens, this takes about 5 minutes or so. It is important not to use too high a heat as the eggs will scramble. The mix will not become really thick, the chilling process with thicken it further. I like to check the sweetness level at this stage, you can add a little more sugar if you wish, but if you do, stir it through until it dissolves. Put your tapioca pudding in a clean, cool bowl, remove the vanilla bean and set aside to cool. When it has cooled, cover with cling film and put in the fridge.Now for the pineapple.",
